# Welcome to the Workout Log!

This is a React application buildout exploring how to pass data up and down through the components. This application utillizes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality through the lens of React and works in tandem with my previously built [Workout Log Server](https://github.com/CLTsolutions/workoutLogServer) and the API we built for it.

The Workout Log application is an activity log for user generated workouts. Users are able to track their workouts and see previous workouts in their library. Users can also edit and delete workouts. This app is intended to be a learning tool to better understand React and the underlying concepts of this library.

## Topics Covered
* React class and functional components
* React hooks
* React useState and useEffect
* Routing the application from parent components
* Passing props to children
* Sending data in a React application
